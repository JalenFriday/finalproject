# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Rainbow Nonomino

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A modified sudoku puzzle, with varying shapes and patterns to increase the difficulty.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

A game of sudoko, modified to incorporate aspects of Nonomino, creating a variety of different shapes and patterns instead of the traditional squares, which will manipulate the difficulty of the game at random. The software will create the 'game board,' and generate random shapes, then fill the shapes with various colors so that each section is a different color. It will otherwise function as a typical sudoko game with the typical rules.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable (not applicable)

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Aria Watson, aria.watson@temple.edu, Xinwen Zhang
Raseed Parham, raseed.parham@temple.edu, Xinwen Zhang

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I would say that a 'good' outcome would be just the basic sudoku board with each section being a different color

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A 'better' outcome would be that from 'good,' but so that the colors of each section are randomly generated, and the sections are a variety of different shapes.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The 'best' outcome would be that from 'better' but so that the sections, which would be in various non-sqaure shapes, are randomly generated while still maintaining the rules of the game(essentially the game still functions and is playable no matter the shapes generated), basically a fully functioning game. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

One of the main things the whole group definitely will be working on developing is an understanding of Pygame, which will be extremely benificial in developing and editing our game. We will also need to do research on Nonomino and all the rules of sudoko. We will most likely split up the work evenly as the project progresses, so that each of us has a good understanding and contribution to each aspect of it.
